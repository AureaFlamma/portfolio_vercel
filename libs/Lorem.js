  about:
    "My name's Philip. I'm a full stack software developer. Artistic by nature, I have a passion for creating stunning and accesible designs. As a keen problem-solver I love solving problems, whether on the front- or the backend. Backend and data are another passion of mine, in line with the interest in statistics I took away from my degree in Psychology. I have just finished School of Code bootcamp where I spent 16 weeks pair-programming in agile teams and delivering amazing software! I am always looking for exciting projects to contribute to so make sure to check out my github and send me a message (links on the right)!",

  about:
    "I love creating stunning designs and neat functionality on the frontend with data and the backend being my very close second favourite! I just finished the amazing School of Code bootcamp where I spent 16 weeks pair programming in agile teams and delivering cool software (which you can see above). My stack includes React.js, Next.js, Express.js, SQL, CSS, Tailwind, Chakra UI and much more! I work best in Agile teams and am familiar with GitHub Flow, version control and code reviews. I’m always on the lookout for new challenging projects to contribute to, so make sure to contact me if you’d like to collaborate!",
